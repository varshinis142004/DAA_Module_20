# EX 2D BACKTRACKING - GRAPH COLORING PROBLEM
## DATE:
## AIM:
To solve the Graph Coloring Problem using backtracking

## Algorithm
1. Start with the first vertex and try assigning each of the m colors to it.
2. For each vertex, check if assigning a color is safe (i.e., no adjacent vertex has the same color).
3. If it’s safe, assign the color and recursively try to color the next vertex.
4. If all vertices are colored without conflicts, print the color assignments.
5. If no valid coloring exists, return false.

            if self.graph[v][i] == 1 and colour[i] == c:

        for c in range(1, m + 1):
            if self.isSafe(v, colour, c) == True:
                colour[v] = c
                if self.graphColourUtil(m, colour, v + 1) == True:
                    return True
                colour[v] = 0

    def graphColouring(self, m):
        colour = [0] * self.V
        if self.graphColourUtil(m, colour, 0) == None:
            return False
        print ("Solution exist and Following are the assigned colours:")
        for c in colour:
            print (c,end=' ')

## Result:
The Graph Coloring program executed successfully, and the colors were assigned to the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.ed successfully, and the result was determined based on whether a subset matching the target sum was found or not.
