# EX 2B BACKTRACKING - NQUEEN PROBLEM
## DATE:
## AIM:
To solve the N-Queen problem using backtracking, which places N queens on an N*N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.


## Algorithm
1. Start with an empty board of size N x N and attempt to place a queen in each column, one by one.
2. For each row in the current column, check if placing a queen is safe (i.e., no queens threaten each other).
3. If the placement is safe, place the queen and move to the next column recursively.
4. If a valid solution is found (all queens placed), return True; otherwise, backtrack by removing the queen and trying the next row.
5. If all queens are placed successfully, print the board; if not, print "Solution does not exist."
